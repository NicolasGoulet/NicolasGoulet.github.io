I am a PhD student at **HEC × MILA** under the supervision of Prof.&nbsp;Eva Portelance,  
working on language acquisition in humans and machines.  
Previously, I spent seven years with Prof.&nbsp;Stevan Harnad; my master’s *mémoire*  
focused on Minimal Grounding Sets.

Away from academia I enjoy practicing piano, music production, and reading.
