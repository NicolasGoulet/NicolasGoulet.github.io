 I am a PhD student at <strong>HEC × MILA</strong> under the supervision of Prof. Eva Portelance, working on language acquisition in humans and machines.Previously, I worked seven years with Prof. Stevan Harnad; my master’s mémoire focused on Minimal Grounding Sets. Away from academia I enjoy practicing piano, music production, and reading.
